# BoggleCracker

This is an itty bitty piece of code to crack a game of [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle). 
It contains the Polish game dictionary, which could be replaced with any other (as long as you change 
the CultureInfo adequately as well.

For best results open in Xamarin Studio.

to run:
    mono BoggleCracker.exe ~/repos/BoggleCracker/res/sjp-20151013/slowa-win.txt
